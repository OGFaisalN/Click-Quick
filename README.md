# Click-Quick

Click Quick, an online single-player or multiplayer game where one has to compete with AI or friends to click on four squares in a row. Seems simple enough! The only trick is, all the squares in the row must be the same color, and your mouse changes color every half second. To win, simply wait for the mouse cursor to change to your color, click on a square, and fill in the row. This game tests speed and accuracy, as the colors change quickly and the first to get a full row wins the round.
